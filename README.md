# Employee-Records
This program will take an employee's name, id, salary, and the start date and put them in a list. All the employees can be listed, and an employee can be removed using their ID. 
To use the program, download all the files, open them through a Java IDE, and run the file "U2A2.java" located inside the "src" folder.
